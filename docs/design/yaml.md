# Why YAML?

It's way too easy to inadvertently delete a song from a playlist (anything you delete from your library will also be deleted from any playlist). Having a human-readable format makes it easy to check playlist contents against the file easily and edit the file manually if needed. Having a machine-readable format makes it easier to script playlist creation if that's needed someday in the future. YAML does both.
